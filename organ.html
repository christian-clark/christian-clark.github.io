      (on a grad student budget)

      <p>
        I developed an interest in organ playing in college, but when I moved to Ohio for graduate school, I lost access to a practice instrument.

      <img style="width:75%;" class="center" src="organ.jpg">

      <p>
        Components:
        <ul>
          <li>6-foot folding table</li>
          <li>3 cheap MIDI keyboards</li>
          <li>Pedalboard salvaged from an old home organ</li>
          <li>Pedalboard MIDI conversion kit from <a href="https://www.midiboutique.com/">MIDI Boutique</a></li>
          <li>Software: <a href="https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue">GrandOrgue</a>, run on my laptop</li>
        </ul>
